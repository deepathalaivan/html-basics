        <h2>GEORGIA</h2>
        <h3>Atlanta</h3>
        <P>The history of Atlanta dates back to 1836, when Georgia decided to build a railroad 
            to the U.S. Midwest and a location was chosen to be the line's terminus. 
            The stake marking the founding of "Terminus" was driven into the ground in 1837 
            (called the Zero Mile Post). In 1839, homes and a store were built there 
            and the settlement grew. Between 1845 and 1854, rail lines arrived from four 
            different directions, and the rapidly growing town quickly became the rail hub 
            for the entire Southern United States. During the American Civil War, Atlanta, 
            as a distribution hub, became the target of a major Union campaign, and in 1864,
            Union William Sherman's troops set on fire and destroyed the city's assets and buildings,
            save churches and hospitals. After the war, the population grew rapidly, as did 
            manufacturing, while the city retained its role as a rail hub. Coca-Cola was launched 
            here in 1886 and grew into an Atlanta-based world empire. Electric streetcars 
            arrived in 1889,[1] and the city added new "streetcar suburbs".</P>

              <H2>FLORIDA</H2>
              <BOLD><B>Florida joined the Union as the 27th state in 1845 and is nicknamed the Sunshine State 
                for its balmy climate and natural beauty. Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon, 
                who led the first European expedition to Florida in 1513, named the state 
                in honor of Spain’s Easter celebration known as “Pascua Florida,” or Feast of Flowers. 
                European settlers, mainly from Spain, arrived in the 17th and 18th centuries</B> </P>
